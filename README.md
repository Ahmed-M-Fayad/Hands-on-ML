# Hands-On Machine Learning: Personal Notes

Welcome to my personal collection of notes, code examples, and Jupyter notebooks developed as I work through **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by *AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron*. This repository serves as a hands-on guide to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts while exploring practical implementations and real-world examples.
