# Hands-On Machine Learning: My Learning Journey  

This repository is a personal collection of notes, examples, and Python notebooks created as I work through **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by *AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron*.  

The goal of this repository is to document my understanding and progress while exploring the concepts and techniques described in the book. It serves as a reference for myself and a way to solidify what Iâ€™ve learned by applying it practically.  

By sharing this, I hope it may also help others studying the book or learning machine learning.

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
